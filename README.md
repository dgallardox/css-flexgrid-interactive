Learning Reflection:

Each flexbox container will be on its own line. To have multiple on the same line, use "inline-flex" instead of "flex". By using CSS variables, I can dynamically change CSS properties using JavaScript. 

CSS variables are declared with the following synatax:
--varName: <varValue>;

CSS variables can be used with the following syntax:
Display: var(--varName)
